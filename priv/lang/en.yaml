# Main translation file for amybot. 
# en is the default locale, and as such this file will always be up-to-date

# How to make a translation:
# 1. Copy this file up to the line
# 2. Change the file name and the 'name' value
# 3. Translate. Do NOT replace the $whatever with its equivalent in your language.
#    For example, "$amount" should be "$amount" regardless of language. This is so
#    that it can be used in filling in values in translation. 

# The language name. Used for showing a menu. Should be localized into the
# target language.
